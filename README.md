# Innovation Rates of US Colleges
## Background
I used Microsoft Excel to conduct data analysis on the innovation rates of US Colleges. I used open data from Opportunity Insights on College Data to generate a cluster analysis model to determine how different colleges are grouped based on metrics related to student innovation. 

## Business Question
How are different colleges grouped based on metrics related to university size, patent grants and citations obtained by students?

I generated a three anchor cluster analysis on US colleges based on student population, number of patents granted to students and number of patent citations obtained by students.

Pictured below are the results of the cluster analysis:

The University of Kansas cluster consists of schools with above average student count, above average patent grants and a high number of patent citations. The San Mateo County Community College District cluster consists of schools with average student counts, below average patent grants but a high number of patent citations. The Purdue University cluster consists of schools with high student counts, high number of patent grants, and a high number of patent citations.

The results suggests that schools with higher student counts will have greater student innovation as schools with higher student populations have a greater number of student patent grants and student patent citations. This may be due to greater amounts of resources and opportunities available to students in schools with a large student population. However, even in schools with average student populations, high amounts of patent citations are recorded, this is likely due to successful patent grants in the past. As such, schools with smaller student populations should give more opportunities to student innovation if possible, and in cases where this is not possible, to focus on the quality of the patents cited by others.
